TimeGlider JSON - Java Stubs
============================
This is a simple project to give me a chance to serialize from Java to
[Timeglider][1]'s JSON format.

I've basically provided 3 base classes(Event, Legend, Timeline) that you can build to populate your
timeline, then just throw it at Google's [GSON][3] object to generate your JSON
format.  Gson is a pretty nifty library, btw.
